This app is a simple Monte Carlo simulation of rounds of the shooter's play in the game of Craps. No wagering actions are presented or evaluated; the wins, losses, and winning percentage are simply tallied and presented, along with a snapshot of the most recent round of dice rolls.

While it's possible to compute the exact theoretical probability of a win for the shooter, doing so requires a working understanding of probability and infinite series. This app takes a different approach: it applies the _Monte Carlo method,_ simulating a large number of trials of the stochastic process of interest (in this case, the shooter's rolls of the dice) to compute an approximation of one or more process statistics.
