This is a simple Monte Carlo simulation of the shooter's play in the game of Craps. While the theoretical probability of a win for the shooter can be computed, doing so requires a working understanding of probability and infinite series. This app takes a different approach: simulating a large number of rounds of dice rolls, then tallying and presenting the wins, losses, and computed winning percentage. By the law of large numbers, the computed percentage asymptotically approaches the true probability as the number of rounds increases.
